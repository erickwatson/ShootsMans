A simple way to add netoworking to your Unity Project

HOW TO BUILD DEMO PROJECT:

1. Go the [File] menu and open [Build Settings]

2. With the Build Settings window open, drag in the 'Menu' and 'Main'
   scenes from the 'DemoScenes' folder.

3. Build the project, and once done, run two instances of the project
   in order to set up a Host and Client on your machine. 
   You can do this by either running the game from within Unity or
   opening two .exe files side by side.
